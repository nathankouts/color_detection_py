# Color Detection Python Project
A simple python program that opens an image and detects the color of the pixel that we double clicked on.
All the necessary instructions are written as comments in the python file.

How to run the program instructions:
1. Open CMD
2. Open the directory of the python file (ex. cd "C:\Users\<YourUserFolderName>\Python\"
3. After you have opened the folder you need to type first python then the python file's name. Next, type --image and then add your      image's path (ex. python color_detector.py --image "C:\User\<YourUserFolderName>\Downloads\image.jpg\"
4. Now, you are going to see the image open in a new window and your mouse cursor will be a cross. Double-click anywhere in the image    you want in order to see the color and the RGB values of each color.

I have uploaded screenshots of how the program looks when it's running and the commands that you need to type.
